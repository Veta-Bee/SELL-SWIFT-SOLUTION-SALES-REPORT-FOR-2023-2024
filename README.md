**INTRODUCTION**

Sell-Swift Solution Report presents a comprehensive overview of sales performance for 2023–2024, highlighting key metrics such as total sales amount ($5,019,265), sales trends by date, amount by customer type, region, product category, payment method, sales channel, and sales representatives, while also showcasing top-performing entities, including the highest sales in Q1 2023, the North region as the top-performing area, Eve as the best sales representative, clothing as the most popular product, and retail as the most profitable channel.

**DATA CLEANING**

The dataset was gotten from Kaggle, and several strategies were applied to ensure data consistency and accuracy:

Duplicate Removal: Duplicate rows were identified and deleted to prevent inconsistent results.
Text to Columns: Combined data points in a single column were split using the Text to Columns function, ensuring each value was properly categorized.
Date Formatting: Inconsistent date entries were corrected, with all dates standardized to a uniform date format for accurate time-based analysis.
Standard Table Conversion: The dataset was transformed into a structured Excel table to enable easier management, automation, and dynamic analysis.
These steps helped transform the raw dataset into a clean, structured foundation for insightful analysis.

Before building the charts, I conducted a pre-analysis to better understand the dataset and guide my storytelling process. This involved breaking down the data into meaningful components:

Project Split: I categorized the data points into dependent and independent variables, helping me understand the relationships within the dataset and what types of insights could be extracted.
Potential Analysis & Questions: From the grouped variables, I generated key questions that the dataset could answer. This step highlighted the potential insights hidden within the data, even before visualizing it.
Preliminary Insights: By thinking through the questions and data points, I uncovered early insights, which made it easier to shape the narrative and focus the analysis on valuable outcomes.
Storytelling: Once I had a clear understanding of the dataset, I could tell a story from it. By putting together the relationships between the datapoints and the insights uncovered.
Industry & Stakeholders: This process helped me identify the relevant industry, the stakeholders who would benefit from the analysis, and what success would look like for the organization based on the findings.

Clothing leads in sales quantity (6,922 units), followed closely by Furniture (6,729), Electronics (6,096), and Food (5,608). The distribution is relatively balanced, with no extreme outliers. This suggests a well-diversified sales portfolio, allowing room for strategic product focus.

**Sales Amount by Region**

The North region has the highest sales amount ($1,369,612.51), followed by East ($1,259,792.93), West ($1,235,608.93), and South ($1,154,250.86). The sales distribution shows a moderate decline across regions, with North performing the best. This suggests a need to strengthen sales strategies in the lower-performing regions to close the gap.

**Sales Rep by unit Price**

Eve leads in sales by unit price ($595,887.25), followed closely by David ($580,640.12) and Bob ($564,954.27), while Charlie has the lowest ($460,547.97). The performance gap suggests that top sales reps are driving a significant portion of revenue. To optimize overall sales, additional training or support may be needed for lower-performing representatives.

**Sales Amount by Payment Method**


Credit Card transactions lead in sales amount ($1,757,563.52), followed closely by Bank Transfers ($1,717,363.17), while Cash transactions are the lowest ($1,544,338.54). The preference for digital payments suggests a shift towards convenience and security. Encouraging digital payment options further could enhance customer experience and streamline transactions.

**Customer Type by Sales Amount**


Sales from returning customers ($2,513,006.93) and new customers ($2,506,258.30) are nearly equal, indicating a well-balanced customer base. This suggests strong customer retention while also attracting new buyers. To sustain growth, strategies should focus on maintaining loyalty while expanding outreach to new markets.

**Sales Channel by Sales Amount**


Retail sales ($2,560,431.30) slightly outperform online sales ($2,458,833.93), indicating a strong physical store presence. However, the close margin suggests that online sales are nearly as significant, highlighting the importance of digital channels. A balanced approach to both retail and online strategies can maximize overall sales performance.

**Sales Amount by Date**


Sales remained relatively stable throughout 2023, with a peak in Q4 ($1,320,505.26), indicating strong year-end performance. However, there is a drastic decline in Q1 2024 ($13,328.01), suggesting a potential operational issue, seasonal drop, or market disruption. Further investigation is needed to identify the cause and implement corrective measures.

**Sales Channel by Discount**


Retail (77.94) has a slightly higher discount rate than Online (74.45), indicating a stronger focus on in-store promotions. The close margin suggests both channels employ similar discount strategies. Further analysis is needed to determine the impact of these discounts on sales and profitability.

Conclusion from the Sell-Swift Solution Sales Analysis Report (2023–2024)
1. Overall Sales Performance
The total sales revenue for the period stands at $5,019,265, indicating strong business performance. However, a sharp decline in Q1 2024 sales (from $1,320,505.26 in Q4 2023 to $19,328.01 in Q1 2024) suggests a critical drop that needs urgent investigation. The decline could be due to seasonal demand shifts, operational challenges, or economic factors affecting consumer spending.

𝟮. 𝗧𝗼𝗽-𝗣𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗦𝗮𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗹𝘀
Retail sales ($2,560,431.30) slightly exceed online sales ($2,458,833.93), demonstrating that in-store purchases remain dominant. However, the relatively high online sales suggest significant growth potential in e-commerce.
Enhancing digital marketing strategies and improving the online shopping experience could help close the gap between online and retail sales.

𝟯. 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁 𝗖𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝗼𝗿𝘆 𝗣𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲
Clothing is the top-performing category in terms of quantity sold (6,922 units) and is also recognized as the best product.
Food (6,729), Furniture (6,096), and Electronics (5,608) follow closely, showing diverse customer preferences.
The focus should remain on clothing, but there is potential for growth in electronics and furniture sales through better promotions or discount strategies.

𝟰. 𝗕𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗣𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗥𝗲𝗴𝗶𝗼𝗻
The North region leads in sales with $1,369,612.51, followed by the East ($1,259,792.93), West ($1,235,608.93), and South ($1,154,250.86).
South has the lowest sales, which suggests the need for improved marketing efforts or better sales strategies in that region.

𝟱. 𝗦𝗮𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗥𝗲𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗣𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲
Eve is the top-performing sales representative, generating the highest unit price sales ($595,887.25), outperforming David ($580,640.12), Bob ($564,954.27), Alice ($526,410.51), and Charlie ($460,547.97).
Eve’s expertise in sales could be leveraged to train underperforming representatives to boost overall sales efficiency.

𝟲. 𝗖𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗿 𝗧𝘆𝗽𝗲 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗯𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻
Sales are evenly split between new ($2,513,006.93) and returning customers ($2,506,258.30).
This indicates a balanced approach to acquiring new customers while maintaining loyalty among existing ones.
Strengthening customer retention strategies (loyalty programs, personalized offers) could encourage repeat purchases and long-term customer engagement.

7. 𝗣𝗮𝘆𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗠𝗲𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗱𝘀 𝗣𝗿𝗲𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲
Credit card transactions ($1,757,563.52) are the most preferred, followed by bank transfers ($1,717,363.17), while cash transactions ($1,544,338.54) are the least used.
This suggests a shift toward digital payment options, indicating a potential opportunity to expand cashless transaction incentives for a better customer experience.
